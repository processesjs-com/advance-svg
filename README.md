# advance-svg

JavaScript library for advancing SVG graphics with:
* responsive behaviour and
* popup shapes

The responsive behaiour allows fitting a graphic to pre-defined rectangular boundries, depending on the container's (div tag) width.
The graphics shall define four rectangular boudries: Thumbnail, Small, Medium and Large.

The popup shapes are hidden. When clicking on a popuplink the corresponding popup shape shows over.

Five types of shapes can be set in the graphic:
* displayX  - define boundaries to fit various screen sizes: Thumb, Small, Medium and Large
* popup     - shapes that are hidden and show over a popuplink when clicked
* popuplink - shapes that link to a pupup
* pagelink  - link to another graphic which will replace the current one within the same container
* hyperlink - link to another page in the browser

The library can be used from CDN or as NPM module.
